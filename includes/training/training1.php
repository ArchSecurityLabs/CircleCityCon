</p>
<h4>.:abstract:.</h4>
<p>
This unique, never before offered class will provide attendees with hands-on experience in many facets of information security. Students will get acquainted with using the tools in a pentester’s arsenal with exercises based on real world scenarios.  Areas covered will include attacking desktops and servers over the network, client side attacks, social engineering, open source intelligence gathering, attacking networking equipment, attacking mobile devices, attacking web apps, attacking wireless, etc. Each section will assume no prior knowledge of the field and will include hands-on exercises where we work through one together and a similar exercise is left for the student to solve independently or with classmates. The course will finish with a small capture the flag type scenario with targets covering the skills from the course, with a few harder challenges thrown in. This class is ideal for aspiring pentesters and researchers who haven’t quite decided what field they would like to focus on, allowing them to get a taste of many different areas of penetration testing. This class is suitable for security beginners, though even seasoned pentesters will likely encounter tools and techniques they are not familiar with.

<h4>.:prerequisites:.</h4> 
<p>
No prior pentesting knowledge is expected.
Basic Linux skills are helpful. These will be covered quickly at the beginning of class, but this class is very hands-on and uses Kali Linux extensively, so being comfortable at the Linux command line prior to class will allow you to focus on the pentesting exercises.
