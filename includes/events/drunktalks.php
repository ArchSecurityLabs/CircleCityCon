<h2>.:drunk talks:.</h2>
    
<h3>.:what the heck is this?:.</h3>
<p>
    These are impromptu talks, which will be first come first serve talks. These talks will be scheduled at the start of the event. There will be no schedule released before the con at all (since we don't know), you just have to come, and see the action! We except there will be adult language, and consumption of alcohol. 
</p>
<h3>.:can I still get a speaker badge?:.</h3>
<p>
    No. If you want a speaker badge, you need to go through the CFP process, <a href="http://circlecitycon.com/cfp.php">HERE</a>. Please observe the rules, dates, and times for CFP submission process. 
</p>
<h3>.:what is the content?:.</h3>
<p>
    Nobody knows, the content will be pretty random. If you come up with an idea, or have an idea has been hanging out in your head for while, then come, and talk.  
</p>
<h3>.:what are the rules?:.</h3>
<p>
    There aren't really any rules at all, try to limit the topics to some form of computer security, and try to have somewhat of an outline. If you feel the need to throw together a bunch of slides together, go ahead we have the projector. There will be a moderator on hand, and I'm sure the crowd will be involved. 
</p>
<h3>.:will these talks be filmed?:.</h3>
<p>
    More than likely they will not be filmed, so we will just say no, given the potiental nature of these talks combinated with alcohol. If you feel like your potiental talk might want to be filmed, let us know at the time of sign up, and we will see what we can do. 
</p>
<h3>.:questions?:.</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this event feel free to reach out to us.</p>
