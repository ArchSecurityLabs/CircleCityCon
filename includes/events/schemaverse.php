<p>
The Schemaverse is a space-based strategy game implemented entirely within a PostgreSQL database. Play fair and write your best AI to compete or attack the game itself to get your name to the top.
<br/><br/>
This will be the one of the first Schemaverse tournaments where players will be able to submit items to use in-game. Try your hand at some clever obfuscation to get your (mostly) angelic code past our crack team of code reviewers.
<br /> 
<h3>.:prizes:.</h3>
