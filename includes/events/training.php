<h3>.:hands-on pentesting bootcamp:.</h3>
<p>
    Trainer: Georgia Weidman (<a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgiaWeidman">@GeorgiaWeidman</a>), and is a two day class.
</p>
<h4>.:abstract:.</h4>
<p>
This unique, never before offered class will provide attendees with hands-on experience in many facets of information security. Students will get acquainted with using the tools in a pentester’s arsenal with exercises based on real world scenarios.  Areas covered will include attacking desktops and servers over the network, client side attacks, social engineering, open source intelligence gathering, attacking networking equipment, attacking mobile devices, attacking web apps, attacking wireless, etc. Each section will assume no prior knowledge of the field and will include hands-on exercises where we work through one together and a similar exercise is left for the student to solve independently or with classmates. The course will finish with a small capture the flag type scenario with targets covering the skills from the course, with a few harder challenges thrown in. This class is ideal for aspiring pentesters and researchers who haven’t quite decided what field they would like to focus on, allowing them to get a taste of many different areas of penetration testing. This class is suitable for security beginners, though even seasoned pentesters will likely encounter tools and techniques they are not familiar with.
</p>
<h4>.:prerequisites:.</h4> 
<p>
No prior pentesting knowledge is expected.
Basic Linux skills are helpful. These will be covered quickly at the beginning of class, but this class is very hands-on and uses Kali Linux extensively, so being comfortable at the Linux command line prior to class will allow you to focus on the pentesting exercises.
</p>
<h4>.:what to bring:.</h4>
<p>
Laptop capable of running 2 virtual machine at the same time (at least 2GB RAM, 4GB+ recommended)
VMWare software (Fusion, Workstation, Player). Free trials are fine.

<h3>.:From Data to Intelligence:. <br/>
    .:Deriving Predictive Insights with OSINT:.</h3>
<p>
    trainer: Steven Fox (<a href="https://twitter.com/securelexicon">@securelexicon</a>)
</p>
<h4>.:abstract:.</h4>
<p>
    The Internet is replete with information resources which communicate information about people/organizations. These resources may have little value in isolation.  However, nothing exists in true isolation.  Recent high-profile breaches, and revelations of State secrets, demonstrate that insight of predictive value can be found by identifying the connections between these public information. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) comprises an analytical process where this information is collected, distilled and deployed for use in a variety of scenarios. This process reveals the information associated with physical assets, enabling us to interface strategically with the world.
 <br/>
    Attendees will learn the fundamentals behind cyber intelligence collection and analysis, and how these current methods can be deployed in their organizations during this two day workshop. The first session covers the lifecycle, OSINT techniques, and introduces basic information gathering and analysis tools.   Attendees will learn the target of interest, along with the rules of engagement and the report template during this session.  Day two will find the investigative teams deep in reconnaissance of both Internet resources and clues shared during the workshop.  Participant teams will report actionable intelligence gathered during their investigation on the second session of the workshop.  These deliverables summarize how the teams applied their knowledge. The top scoring teams will be recognized!
<br/>
Note: This is not intended as an in-depth tutorial on any of the software applications introduced during the workshop.  Resources for individual exploration will be provided.
