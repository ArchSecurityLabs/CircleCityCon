                    Title: Agile Defensive Technologies <br />
                    First Name: Robert <br />
                    Last Name: Johnston <br />
                    Organization: DoD <br />
                    Topic(s): Defense (Blue Team) <br />

                <p>
                        In order to proactively defend an enterprise network the security team
                        must employ a strategy that is technically precise, agile, and
                        versatile to change. The ability to successfully mold with the
                        evolving adversary will be critical in successfully defending an
                        enterprise network. Using the Cyber Kill Chain as a framework, Agile
                        Defensive Technologies, outlines the interdependencies between
                        organizational intelligence, open source intelligence, and network
                        security personnel working together to implement a synergistic
                        approach to network defense. Currently enterprise environments conduct
                        defensive operations utilizing virus or signature definitions
                        containing a one-to-one match with a database definition. The
                        one-to-one match style of defense can be easily circumvented by
                        attackers using common open source techniques. Utilizing Indicators of
                        Compromise (IOC) as a defensive weapon, organizations will be able to
                        develop flexible detection techniques that can adapt with the
                        adversary as they modify or change their tactics, techniques, and
                        procedures.
                </p>

                        Open IOC’s are an industry standard developed by Mandiant Corporation.
                        They are a flexible concatenation of forensic elements that can be
                        reviewed to identify intrusions on your enterprise network. IOC’s can
                        be developed to identify a multitude of threat activity, everything
                        from a specific malware family to a broad scoped adversary
                        methodology. Conceptually you want your IOC’s to do three things:
                        Identify only adversary activity, be inexpensive for defensive forces
                        to research and develop, and expensive for the adversary to evade. In
                        other words, the attacker would drastically have to change his
                        tactics, tools, or approach, making your network an undesirable or
                        impossible target to breach. With more than 500 different attributes
                        to identify a particular malware family or methodology, giving IOC’s a
                        one-to-five hundred match, there are very few places on an information
                        system that an adversary can hide. In this game, the organizations
                        with the most flexible tactics win.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Organizational intelligence can be a great stimulus to developing good
                        indicators; Governmental organizations have the unique authority and
                        capability to conduct intelligence collection operations against
                        adversary networks, enumerating tools and capabilities. Similarly,
                        corporations with a strong monitoring and detection capability,
                        frequently targeted by attackers, can develop a stunning volume of
                        organizational intelligence related to attack groups occupying their
                        networks. Organizational intelligence collected will feed the
                        development and implementation of IOC’s by network security personnel.
                        Using the simple formula (Intelligence Collection + Reverse
                        Engineering = IOC’s) Enterprise network environments will be able to
                        better defend the thousands of information systems under their
                        umbrella of responsibility. Intelligence collected via cyber
                        operations during the Reconnaissance and Weaponization phase of the
                        cyber kill chain will be used to create IOC’s to defend against
                        adversary threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Open source intelligence can be another positive stimulus. Initially
                        the open IOC community lacked global cohesion. With the formation of
                        IOC Bucket the cohesive community has been developed to warehouse and
                        distribute global indicators of compromise. The open IOC community is
                        a global framework of public, private, and government entities that
                        embrace the open IOC concept as a method of detection and incident
                        response. This community can baseline the entire Industrial Base
                        presenting a unified defensive strategy enhancing the security of a
                        nation. IOC Bucket allows individuals to submit IOC’s anonymously or
                        credited to the individual or organization. Even more powerful is the
                        search capability, customers can search through its reputation
                        database, for any one of the 500+ indicators in the IOC framework
                        returning IOC matches for download. An Advanced Persistent Threat
                        (APT) could have been discovered in a corporation like General
                        Electric, an IOC developed, then shared anonymously with the
                        community. Other organizations monitoring the community could pull
                        down the IOC and scan across the network to determine if that
                        particular novel APT is present on their network.
                        Providing a flexible model for detection is paramount to success. Full
                        spectrum cyberspace operations is the only tried and true method of
                        successful network defense.

                        As the vulnerability landscape evolves, the threat agent changes with
                        it. Where network level vulnerabilities once ruled, the application
                        layer has become one of the most popular and fruitful surfaces to
                        attack. But most breaches are the result of a multi-faceted effort
                        which combines some level of technical hacking with social
                        engineering.

                        During this session, learn how these blurred lines intersect, how
                        vectors of one paradigm often relate to another. In a talk that
                        approaches the social engineering aspect from a different angle, we'll
                        discuss the OWASP Top 10 list from 2013 and how these attacks can be
                        mapped from web application security to be used to hack the human
                        element. The vulnerabilities found in this Top 10 list are significant
                        in terms of web application security but with the creativity of a
                        composite attacker, learn how they can be used in the physical world
                        and aimed at the weakest link in the security chain, the people, to cause damage or infiltrate
                        an organization. This is a 45 minute presentation built around stories
                        of real world examples, with a 15 minute Q&A or open discussion. This
                        advanced session is aimed at penetration testers, management, and
                        workers on the front lines who might fall prey to social engineering
                        attacks as they interface with the public or an organization's
                        customer base.

                <p>
                    InfoSec and many other Technical career paths require professional
                    communication in one form or another for many different reasons.
                    Rather submitting report to a CEO justifying needed Security
                    investments, or educating users on avoiding Social Engineering, we are
                    often placed in situations that require the ability to effectively
                    disperse information. What is needed are some helpful tips for those
                    getting their feet wet in the industry, and those who find themselves
                    suddenly thrust into a position requiring communication skills, which
                    may have lain dormant for years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This talk is geared toward those who would like some tips and tricks
                    to tailor both the written and spoken word to create a more effective
                    presentation, and hopefully a more receptive audience. This will cover
                    methods we grew up using, but may have forgotten since grade school.
                    The hope is that those who choose to attend will walk away reminded of
                    the importance of communicating clearly, gearing the dispersion of
                    information to the type of expected audience as well as ways to
                    prepare so that the delivery is as painless as possible for all
                    parties.

                    Am I ready for a pentest? <br />
                    
                    As Information Security becomes more and more popular and important,
                    organizations are purchasing penetration tests at an alarming rate
                    with out being properly prepared for the type of testing they have
                    purchased. The majority of penetration tests are easy wins because of
                    a "low hanging fruit" issue that could have been easily remediated by
                    even the most novice network admin. This talk will discuss those
                    issues, how to prepare for a test, and how to be sure you are getting
                    the correct type of test.

                    Home IP cameras are becoming increasingly common thanks to sleek
                    designs, WiFi connectivity, and intuitive mobile applications.
                    Previously, such IP cameras were mostly in-use by home security
                    aficionados and small business owners. Now, however, with increasing
                    video quality and ease of use, these cameras are becoming popular for
                    the average homeowner that wants a bit more confidence that all is
                    well when they're absent. This presentation will provide insight into
                    the security mechanisms being used by the IZON camera, some of the
                    weaknesses found during research, and a few recommendations for them
                    (or anyone else developing these sorts of cameras) to benefit from.
                    Attention will be paid to topics such as network protocols, iOS app
                    security, APIs, and other aspects of the camera's platform that has
                    attack surface.

                    The militaries of the world conduct wargames in order to increase
                    their readiness in the event of an actual incident. The job is to
                    provide security for their respective nations. For those of us
                    responsible for the security of organizations, why should our methods
                    be any different? Protecting any sufficiently sized infrastructure is
                    just like protecting a virtual country; there can be everything from
                    minor skirmishes by untrained personnel (skiddies) to attacks by
                    nation states (APTs) to attacks from within (insider threat). It is
                    paramount that security teams plan, prepare, and execute mitigations
                    for these events. By combining both red and blue team operations in
                    your organization, you can develop comprehensive security exercises
                    that will not only help you identify holes in your existing
                    procedures, but also help you develop new ones all while keeping your
                    team at the top of their game. This talk will explore blueprints for
                    creating such a team, how to integrate it into your existing
                    hierarchy, and how to make it fun!

                    This talk will be a short overview of the basic functionality of bump
                    keys, an explanation of the technique involved, instructions on how to
                    make your own bump keys and will include demonstrations/opportunities
                    for attendees to bump locks.

                    As noob highly addicted to a MMORPG, Loak had bags full of lock boxes
                    and was searching online for how to open them. She mistakenly thought
                    the Columbus LockSport Chapter was the answer to her quest, she
                    attended a beginners night meet-up and has been hooked ever since.
