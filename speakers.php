                    Title: Agile Defensive Technologies <br />
                    First Name: Robert <br />
                    Last Name: Johnston <br />
                    Organization: DoD <br />
                    Topic(s): Defense (Blue Team) <br />

                <p>
                        In order to proactively defend an enterprise network the security team
                        must employ a strategy that is technically precise, agile, and
                        versatile to change. The ability to successfully mold with the
                        evolving adversary will be critical in successfully defending an
                        enterprise network. Using the Cyber Kill Chain as a framework, Agile
                        Defensive Technologies, outlines the interdependencies between
                        organizational intelligence, open source intelligence, and network
                        security personnel working together to implement a synergistic
                        approach to network defense. Currently enterprise environments conduct
                        defensive operations utilizing virus or signature definitions
                        containing a one-to-one match with a database definition. The
                        one-to-one match style of defense can be easily circumvented by
                        attackers using common open source techniques. Utilizing Indicators of
                        Compromise (IOC) as a defensive weapon, organizations will be able to
                        develop flexible detection techniques that can adapt with the
                        adversary as they modify or change their tactics, techniques, and
                        procedures.
                </p>

                        Open IOC’s are an industry standard developed by Mandiant Corporation.
                        They are a flexible concatenation of forensic elements that can be
                        reviewed to identify intrusions on your enterprise network. IOC’s can
                        be developed to identify a multitude of threat activity, everything
                        from a specific malware family to a broad scoped adversary
                        methodology. Conceptually you want your IOC’s to do three things:
                        Identify only adversary activity, be inexpensive for defensive forces
                        to research and develop, and expensive for the adversary to evade. In
                        other words, the attacker would drastically have to change his
                        tactics, tools, or approach, making your network an undesirable or
                        impossible target to breach. With more than 500 different attributes
                        to identify a particular malware family or methodology, giving IOC’s a
                        one-to-five hundred match, there are very few places on an information
                        system that an adversary can hide. In this game, the organizations
                        with the most flexible tactics win.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Organizational intelligence can be a great stimulus to developing good
                        indicators; Governmental organizations have the unique authority and
                        capability to conduct intelligence collection operations against
                        adversary networks, enumerating tools and capabilities. Similarly,
                        corporations with a strong monitoring and detection capability,
                        frequently targeted by attackers, can develop a stunning volume of
                        organizational intelligence related to attack groups occupying their
                        networks. Organizational intelligence collected will feed the
                        development and implementation of IOC’s by network security personnel.
                        Using the simple formula (Intelligence Collection + Reverse
                        Engineering = IOC’s) Enterprise network environments will be able to
                        better defend the thousands of information systems under their
                        umbrella of responsibility. Intelligence collected via cyber
                        operations during the Reconnaissance and Weaponization phase of the
                        cyber kill chain will be used to create IOC’s to defend against
                        adversary threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Open source intelligence can be another positive stimulus. Initially
                        the open IOC community lacked global cohesion. With the formation of
                        IOC Bucket the cohesive community has been developed to warehouse and
                        distribute global indicators of compromise. The open IOC community is
                        a global framework of public, private, and government entities that
                        embrace the open IOC concept as a method of detection and incident
                        response. This community can baseline the entire Industrial Base
                        presenting a unified defensive strategy enhancing the security of a
                        nation. IOC Bucket allows individuals to submit IOC’s anonymously or
                        credited to the individual or organization. Even more powerful is the
                        search capability, customers can search through its reputation
                        database, for any one of the 500+ indicators in the IOC framework
                        returning IOC matches for download. An Advanced Persistent Threat
                        (APT) could have been discovered in a corporation like General
                        Electric, an IOC developed, then shared anonymously with the
                        community. Other organizations monitoring the community could pull
                        down the IOC and scan across the network to determine if that
                        particular novel APT is present on their network.
                        Providing a flexible model for detection is paramount to success. Full
                        spectrum cyberspace operations is the only tried and true method of
                        successful network defense.

                        As the vulnerability landscape evolves, the threat agent changes with
                        it. Where network level vulnerabilities once ruled, the application
                        layer has become one of the most popular and fruitful surfaces to
                        attack. But most breaches are the result of a multi-faceted effort
                        which combines some level of technical hacking with social
                        engineering.

                        During this session, learn how these blurred lines intersect, how
                        vectors of one paradigm often relate to another. In a talk that
                        approaches the social engineering aspect from a different angle, we'll
                        discuss the OWASP Top 10 list from 2013 and how these attacks can be
                        mapped from web application security to be used to hack the human
                        element. The vulnerabilities found in this Top 10 list are significant
                        in terms of web application security but with the creativity of a
                        composite attacker, learn how they can be used in the physical world
                        and aimed at the weakest link in the security chain, the people, to cause damage or infiltrate
                        an organization. This is a 45 minute presentation built around stories
                        of real world examples, with a 15 minute Q&A or open discussion. This
                        advanced session is aimed at penetration testers, management, and
                        workers on the front lines who might fall prey to social engineering
                        attacks as they interface with the public or an organization's
                        customer base.

                <p>
                    InfoSec and many other Technical career paths require professional
                    communication in one form or another for many different reasons.
                    Rather submitting report to a CEO justifying needed Security
                    investments, or educating users on avoiding Social Engineering, we are
                    often placed in situations that require the ability to effectively
                    disperse information. What is needed are some helpful tips for those
                    getting their feet wet in the industry, and those who find themselves
                    suddenly thrust into a position requiring communication skills, which
                    may have lain dormant for years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This talk is geared toward those who would like some tips and tricks
                    to tailor both the written and spoken word to create a more effective
                    presentation, and hopefully a more receptive audience. This will cover
                    methods we grew up using, but may have forgotten since grade school.
                    The hope is that those who choose to attend will walk away reminded of
                    the importance of communicating clearly, gearing the dispersion of
                    information to the type of expected audience as well as ways to
                    prepare so that the delivery is as painless as possible for all
                    parties.

                    Am I ready for a pentest? <br />
                    
                    As Information Security becomes more and more popular and important,
                    organizations are purchasing penetration tests at an alarming rate
                    with out being properly prepared for the type of testing they have
                    purchased. The majority of penetration tests are easy wins because of
                    a "low hanging fruit" issue that could have been easily remediated by
                    even the most novice network admin. This talk will discuss those
                    issues, how to prepare for a test, and how to be sure you are getting
                    the correct type of test.

                    Home IP cameras are becoming increasingly common thanks to sleek
                    designs, WiFi connectivity, and intuitive mobile applications.
                    Previously, such IP cameras were mostly in-use by home security
                    aficionados and small business owners. Now, however, with increasing
                    video quality and ease of use, these cameras are becoming popular for
                    the average homeowner that wants a bit more confidence that all is
                    well when they're absent. This presentation will provide insight into
                    the security mechanisms being used by the IZON camera, some of the
                    weaknesses found during research, and a few recommendations for them
                    (or anyone else developing these sorts of cameras) to benefit from.
                    Attention will be paid to topics such as network protocols, iOS app
                    security, APIs, and other aspects of the camera's platform that has
                    attack surface.

                    The militaries of the world conduct wargames in order to increase
                    their readiness in the event of an actual incident. The job is to
                    provide security for their respective nations. For those of us
                    responsible for the security of organizations, why should our methods
                    be any different? Protecting any sufficiently sized infrastructure is
                    just like protecting a virtual country; there can be everything from
                    minor skirmishes by untrained personnel (skiddies) to attacks by
                    nation states (APTs) to attacks from within (insider threat). It is
                    paramount that security teams plan, prepare, and execute mitigations
                    for these events. By combining both red and blue team operations in
                    your organization, you can develop comprehensive security exercises
                    that will not only help you identify holes in your existing
                    procedures, but also help you develop new ones all while keeping your
                    team at the top of their game. This talk will explore blueprints for
                    creating such a team, how to integrate it into your existing
                    hierarchy, and how to make it fun!

                <p>
                    This talk will be a short overview of the basic functionality of bump
                    keys, an explanation of the technique involved, instructions on how to
                    make your own bump keys and will include demonstrations/opportunities
                    for attendees to bump locks.

                    As noob highly addicted to a MMORPG, Loak had bags full of lock boxes
                    and was searching online for how to open them. She mistakenly thought
                    the Columbus LockSport Chapter was the answer to her quest, she
                    attended a beginners night meet-up and has been hooked ever since.

Title:Ten Commandments of Incident Response (For Hackers)<br />
First Name:Lesley<br />
Last Name:Carhart<br />
Organization:Motorola Solutions<br />
Topic(s):Defense (Blue Team)<br />
</p>
<p>
Abstract:For many infosec professionals, a logical career move is to
an incident response role; managing security incidents as well as the
people working on them. The transition to red tape, bureaucracy, and
human chaos can be baffling and very frustrating to the hacker
mentality. This can lead to us to burn out, or in the worst case, fail
at the job. Instead of discussing incident response methodology, this
talk will cover ten essential 'lessons learned' about bridging the
infosec world with the business world. Topics include triage,
communication skills, risk assessment, building business
relationships, and presenting our ideas and problems in a way that
interest an organization. The lessons are corroborated with funny,
sad, and surreal IR horror stories.

Title:Moving the Industry Forward - The Purple Team<br />
First Name:David<br />

</p>
<p>
Abstract:Let's start off with a strong statement - pentesting today
isn't working. The blue team today isn't working. When a pentest
occurs, even done by some of the industries leading folks and the
quality is there - the pentesters go in, blow stuff up, write the
report and leave a trail of destruction to be cleaned up until the
next pentest. The next year, the same thing, the year after that the
same thing. The blue team on the other hand is tasked with securing
the entire company and one flaw exposes the entire organization to
attack. I'm here to tell you that we can accomplish both and continue
to strengthen how we defend and build detection - its called the
Purple Team. Instead of doing covert testing, move to more of a
blended approach and build out defenses against the entire lifecycle
of a hack. This talk goes into how to structure the best and effective
purple team within an organization as well as walk through a number of
different attacks and how to defend them. Like my normal talks, I'll
be going through the Social-Engineer Toolkit and how you can actively
block its attacks and use some cutting edge things that haven't been
discussed before on how to block the attacks in the toolkit.

Title:The Challenge of Natural Security Systems<br />
First Name:Rockie<br />

Topic(s):Hybrid Offense/Defense<br />
</p>
<p>
Abstract:Static security models and "business as usual" directives
have naturally resulted in a collective eyes wide shut mentality of
organizational entropy. Organisms, as well as organizations, can only
adapt to changing environments by leaving (or being forced from) their
comfort zones. It should be obvious that today's threat landscape is
changing at a breakneck pace, yet most organizations are seemingly
content in adding "spend" to the annual budget for more systems that
claim to protect against the latest FUD. This is not learning and
without learning adaptation cannot occur. Challenges to the organism
and organization that move them both out of their respective comfort
zones are crucial for successful adaptation. This talk will explore
these adaptation requirements in an effort to develop a framework for
more naturally secure systems and organizations. At its conclusion it
will present a challenge for all those willing to get out of their own
respective comfort zones and organically contribute to naturally
stronger systems and organizations.

Title:Proactive Defense - Eliminating the Low Hanging Fruit<br />
First Name:Matt<br />
Last Name:Kelly<br />
Organization:Crowe Horwath<br />
Topic(s):Hybrid Offense/Defense<br />
</p>
<p>
Abstract:Every year the pen testers (or bad guys) come in, they find
that one missing 08_067 or default tomcat password and own the
network. This talk was inspired by the frustration of constantly
running into the same exact issues on penetration tests, and the huge
challenge IT has in securing their network. This talk will go over the
top security failures we find and more importantly easy things blue
teams can do to get rid of the low hanging fruit and make your pen
testers work hard to escalate privileges. This will not simply
highlight vulnerability scans results, but things we see vulnerability
scanners consistently miss. Things from network traffic manipulation
(network protocols and client side services) and go over automated
ways you can easily find those bad passwords, exploitable machines,
default tomcats, SQL issues, reused local admin, and more, with some
quick tricks to mitigate the problems that have plagued our industry
for years. There is no blinky box involved; this talk is all about
things security engineers can do quickly without breaking the budget,
but still having a real impact on network security.

Title:The TrueCrypt audit: How it happened and what we found<br />
First Name:Kenneth<br />
Last Name:White<br />
Organization:Social & Scientific Systems<br />
Topic(s):Education<br />
</p>
<p>
Abstract:TrueCrypt is an open source file and whole disk encryption
software package that runs on Windows, Macs, and Linux. It has been
downloaded nearly 30 million times, and is one of the most popular
security tools used by journalists, human rights activists, and
countless organizations around the globe. In the 10 years since its
original release by an anonymous development team, however, there had
never been a formal cryptanalysis and security audit of the software.
This presentation is about how the TrueCrypt Audit Project came to
pass and how some of the best security minds, cryptographic engineers
and privacy advocates in the world came together to successfully
conduct a public, crowd-funded, open technical audit of this software.
Details of our findings and the many lessons learned along the way
will be presented. Any and all questions will be answered!

Title:Proper Seasoning Improves Taste<br />
First Name:James<br />
Last Name:Siegel<br />
Topic(s):Defense (Blue Team)<br />
</p>
<p>
Abstract:Systems administration can be a difficult task, when given a
large number of systems to maintain and keep secure. A security-minded
administrator would need to have an eidetic memory or a list to keep
track of all the log in credentials for those machines, but wait a
list is a bad idea. Ensuring that they have the correct packages on
them, and that a breach has not occurred and trusted configs have not
been changed can be a job in and of itself. Amazingly enough, with
some effort, and a little bit of some 'seasoning' some of these
headaches can be remedied and a solution arrived at. Every chef knows
that with just the right amount of 'Salt' a meal can be made right.
This talk will discuss the use of Salt-Stack as a tool for systems
administrators to improve their security posture and maintain those
critical systems with fewer headaches going forward. Setup and
operation of Salt-Stack will be discussed as well as some of the
latest advances in Salt-Stack that do not require a Salt Minion on the
receiving end. Just as Sodium helps the body retain fluids, let's
discuss how Salt-Stack might help retain IP.

Title:How often should you perform a Penetration Test<br />
First Name:Jason<br />

Topic(s):Lightning Talk (20-30 min)<br />
</p>

Abstract:How often should your organization conduct a penetration test
and what is in scope? I get this question quite often from customers
and colleagues. There really is no one correct answer but there is
some guidelines I promote and adhere to. A penetration test or
sometimes called a 'pentest' is a technique of assessing computer and
network security by simulating real time attacks from external and
internal positions. Penetration tests are simply a snap shot of your
attack vectors. It is a means of identifying your high-risk
vulnerabilities and assessing the business impact should an exploit
occur. A penetration test is typically done using commercial and
freeware tools, followed up by a human that verifies vulnerabilities
and attempts to exploit systems or gain escalated privileges. This is
the primary difference between a Penetration test and a Vulnerability
scan. In my professional opinion, anyone in the organization can run a
scan by hitting the 'enter' button. I highly recommend vulnerability
scans to be run from time to time but they are not a substitute for a
true penetration test, which does require the human element. A good
'pentester' will understand what the vulnerability and exploit is
capable of doing. A great 'pentester' will write their own exploit to
attack a system. With threat landscaping changing daily I am not
suggesting you perform a 'pentest' daily or weekly but it is very
necessary to complete one.

Title:Tape Loops for Industrial Control Protocols<br />
First Name:K. Reid<br />
Last Name:Wightman<br />
Organization:Cyber Pacifists<br />
Topic(s):Offense (Red Team)<br />
</p>
<p>
Abstract:In the last twenty years, industrial control systems have
transitioned from esoteric serial networks to slightly less esoteric
Ethernet and IP-based networks. Unfortunately the increased
connectivity has not included an increase in the basic security
posture of industrial protocols.
</p>
<p>
In the 2010s we are now seeing nearly weekly demonstrations of the
lack of security in the protocols that runs our power grid, water
supplies, and gas pipelines.
</p>
<p>
In this talk we demonstrate a new class of attack. While many hackers
are keen to demonstrate malicious control of control systems networks,
we instead opt to show how easy it is to hide the effects of malicious
control from the operators.
